            As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. 
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I felt deeply moved and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>
            <span style="background-color: yellow; padding: 0 5px;">It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>
            In the moonlight, I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
            <span style="color: red;">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</span>
            As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself again:
            <span style="color: red;">"What moves me so deeply about this little prince who is sleeping here is his loyalty to a flowerâ€”the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep."</span>
            And I felt him to be more fragile still. 
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I felt the need to protect him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind.</span>
